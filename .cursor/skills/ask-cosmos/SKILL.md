  Help a team get unstuck by preparing a note worth reading, with the relevant details
  and team name, ready to paste into a Cosmos post or support ticket. Never posts anywhere. Runs the
  health check first so the answer includes whether the stack is healthy. Always produces a
  note, whether or not an actual error was found. If nothing's obviously broken, it still
  gives whoever comes to help the context to start from.
  Use when someone is blocked, something returns an error they can't place, or they ask how
  to get help.

# Ask Cosmos

Most blockers are one of three things: the stack is unhealthy, a filter value doesn't exist,
or the prompt never described what they're searching for. Check those before asking anyone.

## First, check it isn't the stack

Run the health check from `retrieval/login` and `retrieval/dashboard`: get a token, then
read the dashboard. Keep the output; it goes in the note.

If login fails on a fresh attempt, or the dashboard doesn't answer, that's an environment
problem and an organizer needs to see it. Say so plainly rather than suggesting workarounds.

## Then, check the two common ones

- **Search returns nothing.** Confirm the filter values exist with `retrieval/list-metadata`
  before assuming the search is broken. Then consider whether the ingestion prompt ever
  described what they're looking for; if not, that's `ingest/reingest-videos`, not a bug.
- **Something is still indexing.** Re-ingest takes minutes. Check the dashboard rather than
  retrying the search.

## Write the note

Always produce this note, error or not. Show the team the finished note before they share
it. Keep it under 120 words, and use exactly this layout, one line per field:

```
Team: <team name>
Trying to: <one sentence>
Happened: <what failed, with the exact error, at most 3 lines or 300 characters,
           or "No error, stuck on <what>" if nothing actually failed>
Tried: <one line, or "nothing yet">
Health check: <login ok / failed, dashboard ok / failed / not run>
```

Rules for the fields:
- **Team** is `$USERNAME` (or `$PIPELINE`). If neither is set, use the name in
  `/config/<team>.config`. If you still can't tell, write `unknown`; don't ask.
- **Happened** quotes the error text, not a paraphrase, when there is one. If it's longer
  than the cap, keep the first and last lines and cut the middle with `...`. If nothing
  actually failed, say what they're stuck on instead of forcing an error into the field.
  This is the context someone reads before helping, not a bug report.
- No stack traces, logs, file dumps or response bodies. Say which command failed instead.

## Keep it safe to share

Nothing from `config.example` may appear in the note. That means no variable's value,
and no value that came from one: endpoints, bucket and collection names, the pipeline name,
usernames, passwords, keys, tokens, and model ids. Refer to a variable by its name if you
must (for example, "`S3_ENDPOINT` is set"), never by its value. The team name is the one
exception, and it goes only in the `Team` line.

Before showing the draft, replace anything specific with a placeholder:

| Replace | With |
|---------|------|
| URLs and hostnames | `<url>` |
| IP addresses | `<ip>` |
| Anything after `Bearer`, `token=`, `key=`, `password=` | `<redacted>` |
| Bucket, collection, or pipeline names | `<name>` |
| Email addresses and personal names | `<redacted>` |

Then check the draft against your own environment: if any environment variable's value
appears in it, mask that too. Do this without printing the values.

A note with the error text and the health check attached usually gets answered in one
reply. A note that just says "search isn't working," with no error and no health check, needs three.

## Hand it over

This skill prepares the note; it does not post it anywhere. Give the team the one block
of text above to copy. Apply the redaction in "Keep it safe to
share" first.

## Agent instructions

1. Run the health check before anything else, and include its result in the note.
2. Never include anything from `config.example` in the note text, and apply the
   placeholders in "Keep it safe to share" before showing the draft.
3. If the cause is one of the known ones above, say so and offer the fix first, but still
   produce the note. The fix might not land, or the team may want it anyway.
4. If nothing looks broken (health check passes, no known cause fits), don't stall or say
   there's nothing to report. Write the note anyway, with `Happened: No error, stuck on
   <what>`, so someone reading it has enough to start from.
5. Never post, send, or call any external service with the note. Show the draft and let
   the team decide where it goes.
